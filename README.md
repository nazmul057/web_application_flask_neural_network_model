# web_application_flask_neural_network_model

This is a simple Python Flask application that takes in an image, reads it, modifies it and generates a classification using a Machine Learning model.

Points to be noted:
* The main point behind the codes is to generate a machine learning response using python without saving the image in the system.
* The image modifications done here are in accordance to the model used here. Anyone using a different model can modify the image as required.
* The model is not uploaded here as it takes a lot of space. Anyone can use his or her model for web based image classification purposes.
